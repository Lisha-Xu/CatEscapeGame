# CatEscapeGame
Hanyang University-OOP class final project
Introduction: You are a cat and you chase mice in a house. The house has different floors, and higher floors have more mice! The house also contains obstacles which you must walk around, and stairs that go up and down. Finally, the house contains many dogs which will chase you. If you reach the top floor, there is a helicopter in which you can escape. If you reach the helicopter, then you save  the mice you collected in that house, and can advance to the next house. But if a dog reaches you first, then you lose the game!
